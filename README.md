"Drupal 7 Theming Essentials" Video Series Resource Pack
===================================================

This is the collection of files that are used in the "[Drupal 7 Theming Essentials](http://buildamodule.com/collection/drupal-theming-essentials)" video collection on [BuildAModule](http://buildamodule.com). This collection is about changing the output of anything in Drupal, from an entire page to a block. We discuss concepts like:

* How to tell where any output is coming from in Drupal
* When to use a theme function and when to use a file
* How to create a sub-theme
* How to add settings to a theme

Many of the files here use a custom '.step' extension, which are referred to as 'step files'. This convention allows you to open all of the files in the editor of your choice, allows us to make hidden files visible, and makes it clear that the name of the step file is not the name of the final file that you will be using.

Enjoy!
